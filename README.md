# shiny
browser extension demonstration of JS functionality that
- makes  SVGs (or focusable parts) more visible or interpretable for people with various types of vision impairments.
- Makes images or videos High Dynamic Range (high contrast)

My assumption is that this functionality could be adapted to be more selective using precise DOM locators, and enhanced in some cases for specific materials.  So this tool is just a proof of concept test platform.
